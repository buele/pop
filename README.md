Partial Order Planning algorithm implementation
===========



Simple prototype of Partial
Order Planning algorithm implementation in C++11.
This simple project implements a generic Partial Order Planning algorithm. An example
of Block World solution is provided in the application. The core of application
is designed to be generic, Actions, Preconditions, Effects, Plan classes are generic.
The specific implementation in the Block world is defined in the BWname classes.
The algorithm implementation is located in the Pop class.
The project is to consider a prototype to explore and to better understand how planning algorithms work, for educational purposes. This project is the code-part of the fourth assignment of Artificial intelligence Fundamentals course[3] (University of Pisa).
